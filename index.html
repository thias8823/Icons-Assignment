  <h1 class="title"> The Consequences of Remote Work </h1>
  <h3 class="bylinedate"> By Matthias Grenon </h2>

<div class="introconclusion">
<p> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a tectonic shift in the ways our society is structured and operates.
  One major change is in the setting in which we work: many of us no longer go to the office and are working from home.
  By some estimates, Work From Home (also referred to as remote work) has doubled if not tripled since the onset of the pandemic.
  These days, as much as 70 % of employed Americans work remotely for at least part of the week.
  Here are some of the factors that have changed for those working from home. </p/>

    <h3> Time spent working </h3>

  <div class="right-content">
    <p> As a result of COVID related lockdowns, VPN providers have noticed that North American workers are putting in an average of three extra
      work hours per day compared to pre-COVID activity levels. Reasons cited for this increase in work hours are the absence of commute, meaning that
      workers are at their computers earlier, and people staying in during evenings, meaning that they're staying online longer. Interestingly, workers
      in France, Spain and the UK reported a two hour increase in work hours per day by comparison. Work further extending its tentacles into home life
      is a significant issue with COVID-related remote work. </p>

    <h3> Childcare concerns </h3>

  <div class="right-content">
    <p> Remote work in pandemic times presents a specific, shelter-in-place-related challenge: how do workers with children manage having to work during the
      day while taking care of and educating their children with schools closed? A PWC survey on lack of productivity in a pandemic mandated WFH setting
      found that 38 % of respondents cited childcare as thefor their lack of productivity, second only to lack of collaboration with colleagues. The catch with
      the survey is that it didn't segment respondents by family status, which shows that childcare was the primary reason for a slowdown in productivity
      for working parents. </p>

  <div class="left-content">
    <h3> Isolation </h3>

  <div class="right-content">
    <p> For better or worse, the workplace provides many people with a sense of community and belonging. It is unsurprising, then, that remote work can lead
      to feelings of loneliness and isolation for some. Multiple studies show that around 20 % of respondents identify loneliness and isolation as their
      biggest struggle with or least favorite aspect of remote work. A further 17 to 20 % identify difficulties with communication and collaboration as their
      biggest challenge with remote work. Relatedly, 75 % of managers express concern about reduced team cohesiveness, and 70 % are worried about maintaining
      company culture. WFH has negatively affected workers' sense of connection to one another and community.

  <div class="left-content">
     <h3> Burnout </h3>

  </div>

  <div class="right-content">
     <p> The considerable stress of living through a pandemic in conjunction with the impacts of the factors described above can push even the most resilient
      of people to the breaking point. Employee survey data shows that, sadly, that is just what has been happening. In a study conducted in May, about half
      of respondents stated they were experiencing symptoms of burnout during remote work. In July, that number rose to 69 %. If that isn't distressing enough,
      59 % of those surveyed are taking less time off than before the pandemic and 42 % are not planning on taking any time off. Despite the apparent advantages
      of remote work, many people are working themselves to the bone.
  </div>

</div>

<div class="introconclusion">
  <p> Despite the drawbacks and difficulties associated with remote work, survey data shows that around 80 % of employers sampled intend to implement flexible
  remote work policies after the pandemic crisis subsides. Under more "normal" circumstances, more widespread and flexible WFH policies could reasonably be
  expected to benefit workers and their families.
